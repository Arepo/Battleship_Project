Battleships Group Project Readme
================================

This was our first group project - to try and make a console-working version of the game Battleships. Since I was the most confident coder in the group, I learned more about coaching than coding - though I had little sense of how to go about it at the start either.

The Makers approach was quite hands-off in this week, with gradual introductions of ideas and tips as the week progressed. As a result the challenge gradually changed from poking around in the first half of the week to incorporating advice about better practices in the latter. 

It made for some interesting challenges, but not for very workable code. In the end, rather than try to finish this, I wrote a [TicTacToe game](https://github.com/Arepo/tictactoe) to try to apply the lessons learned.
